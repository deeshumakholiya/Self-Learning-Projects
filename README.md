Three cup monte
I created a basic guessing game by combining functions and interactions. The game of 3 Cup Monte served as my inspiration for doing so.
The rules of the game are:
The game has one very simple rule. And that is to correctly guess the red ball in only one of the three boxes. The prerequisite is just not knowing clearly what is in these boxes before guessing. That’s all.

Tick Tac Toe,
The tic-tac-toe game is for two player where one player plays X and the other plays O. The players take turns placing their marks on a grid of three-by-three cells. 
The rules of the agme are:
If a given player gets three marks in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, then that player wins the game. The game will be tied if no one gets three in a row by the time all the cells are marked.

War Card Game
War is a card game typically played by two players. It uses a standard playing card deck. The objective of the game is to win all of the cards.
the rules of the game are:
The deck is divided evenly among the players, giving each a down stack. In unison, each player reveals the top card of their deck—this is a "battle" and the player with the higher card takes both of the cards played and moves them to their stack. Aces are the highest.
If the two cards played are of equal value, then there is a "war".Both players place the next card of their pile face-down (some variants have three face-down cards) and then another card face-up. The owner of the higher face-up card wins the war and adds all the cards on the table to the bottom of their deck. If the face-up cards are again equal then the battle repeats with another set of face-down/up cards. This repeats until one player's face-up card is higher than their opponent's.
Finally, Those who collect the 52 cards at first are declared as the winner !!!

Black Jack 
A standard deck of playing cards has four suits (Hearts, Diamonds, Spades, and Clubs) and thirteen ranks (2 through 10, then the face cards Jack, Queen, King, and Ace) for a total of 52 cards per deck. Jacks, Queens, and Kings all have a rank of 10. Aces have a rank of either 11 or 1 as needed to reach 21 without busting
